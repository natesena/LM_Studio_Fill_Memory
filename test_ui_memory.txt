Graphiti UI Development Success

We have successfully created and deployed a React/Next.js UI for the Graphiti Management Console. The UI runs on port 8080 and provides real-time monitoring of the episode processing queue.

Key achievements:
- Resolved CORS issues that were preventing browser access to the queue status endpoint
- Added OPTIONS endpoint to handle CORS preflight requests in the FastAPI server
- Created a modern dashboard with queue status, active workers, and system health indicators
- Implemented hot reloading for development mode using Next.js with Turbopack
- Set up proper Docker containerization for both development and production environments

Technical implementation:
- Frontend: Next.js 15.4.2 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI server running on port 8100 for queue status
- CORS configuration allows cross-origin requests from localhost:8080
- Real-time updates every 5 seconds with manual refresh capability
- Development mode with hot reloading for instant code updates

The UI successfully displays:
- Queue Status: Number of items in processing queue
- Active Workers: Number of currently active processing workers
- System Health: Overall system status indicator
- Queue Details: Detailed breakdown by group with item lists
- Development indicators for hot reload status

This provides a solid foundation for monitoring Graphiti episode processing and can be extended with additional features like detailed logging, node tracking, and pagination.
