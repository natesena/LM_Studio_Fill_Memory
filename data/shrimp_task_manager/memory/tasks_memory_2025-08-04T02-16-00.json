      "analysisResult": "Safe approach: first understand and validate current queue system, then add monitoring capabilities, then plan persistent queue transition. All changes are read-only and non-breaking.",
      "summary": "Successfully confirmed that we can read the existing in-memory episode_queues and queue_names data structures at runtime using docker exec commands. However, discovered a critical limitation: the current system only tracks items waiting in the queue, not the item currently being processed. When an item is picked up by the worker, it's removed from both episode_queues and queue_names, making it invisible to monitoring tools. This explains why the queue appears empty even when processing is actively happening (as evidenced by Ollama API calls and Neo4j operations in the logs). The reliable commands for reading queue state are documented, but they only show waiting items, not currently processing items.",
